# Render deployment configuration (helper / example)
# Create two services on Render: one for the backend (Java) and one for the frontend (static site)
# This file is a helpful template. Adapt the fields in the Render dashboard or via CLI.

services:
  - name: finance-backend
    type: web
    # Use Docker for full control, or let Render auto-detect build commands
    # If you prefer using Render's build & start commands, set env: native and specify buildCommand/startCommand.
    env: docker
    repo: https://github.com/<your-org-or-user>/<your-repo>
    branch: main
    # Example Dockerfile approach: provide a Dockerfile at repo root that builds the Spring Boot jar and runs it

  - name: finance-frontend
    type: static
    env: static
    repo: https://github.com/<your-org-or-user>/<your-repo>
    branch: main
    # Build command for frontend
    buildCommand: cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build
    # Publish directory for static site (Vite default)
    publishPath: frontend/dist

# Notes:
# - Set environment variables for the backend service on Render: JDBC_DATABASE_URL, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD
# - In the frontend service, add an environment variable VITE_API_BASE set to the backend URL (e.g. https://finance-backend.onrender.com)
# - CORS is already configured in the backend to allow https://*.onrender.com
